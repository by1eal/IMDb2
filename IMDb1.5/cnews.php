And Hudgens, 29, is flattered by the likeness.

“I’ve seen that movie so many times,” she tells People. “My sister and I used to act out the scenes from the movie. It’s still such a go-to of mine. If I still love it, hopefully, this will be a classic for my fans and that they’ll still watch it.”

Just like The Parent Trap, The Princess Switch boasts long-lost lookalikes,</td>

A harsh critic of Donald Trump, the actor has produced a number of paintings that portray the president in particular and his administration in general in a decidedly unfavorable light.

Not everyone was onboard with him doing so: "It was interesting, because when I first starting playing on Twitter like everyone else, I got in trouble because I was honest," Carrey said during Vulture Festival today. "A terrible thing to be on Twitter!"</td>
